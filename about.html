        Growing up as a kid, without a care in the world. I could not have
        imagine how my life up to this point would have played out. You have
        dreams of what you want to accomplish and become. From six to ten I can
        remember I wanted to be an architect, electronic engineer and superman.
        Now from 11 to 16, i still had those dreams but this was the time where
        other influnces started playing tug of war with me. I started trying to
        figure out who I was. Sixteen to twenty-one was a rough period, I must
        say. Can you remember telling your mom, I can't wait to I get big and
        move out. We can laugh at that now. But going through what I went
        through lead me to a 20 year career as a Registered Respiratoy
        therapist, helping others. As I continue on that journey I'm
        <em><strong>forking</strong></em> (do you <strong>git</strong> it) of
        that path as a FullStack Developer student currently at Codex Academy.

        I love watching sports and spending time with my family. I try to
        provide them with much love as I can and explain to them life
        situations. They are going to go through the same process as me, and
        I'll be there for them no matter what as my mom was there for me. On a
        more positive note, how bout them Steelers and my top three food dishes.
