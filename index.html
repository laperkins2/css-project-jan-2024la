        Some say that or want to think that you are doomed when decisions that
        you make in your life leads you down the wrong path. Or that the hand
        that you were dealt at birth had no chance of winning at all. What if I
        tell you that the decisions that you made doesn't have to define your
        life. What if I told you that the hand you was dealt, was not a lost!
        Someone told me that I been through both and made it when a lot of
        people wouldv've gave up. If I would have kept that same mindset, I
        would have agreed. No!! I'm not a victim of my environment. I changed my
        mindset, I wasn't dealt a bad hand, I just had to know how to play it.
        The decision I made, I had to own it. So the second chance that I got,
        that is my story.
